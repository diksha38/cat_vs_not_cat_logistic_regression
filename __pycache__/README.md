# We have developed a logistic regression classifier to recognize cat images by applying neural network concepts. The process began with initializing parameters, followed by calculating the cost function and its gradient. We employed gradient descent for optimization, involving forward and backward propagation to learn the parameters effectively. The model was trained using a dataset of labeled cat and non-cat images, which were preprocessed and flattened into vectors. Throughout the development, we implemented essential functions such as the sigmoid function, parameter initialization, cost calculation, gradient computation, and prediction. Ultimately, these components were integrated into a main model function, enabling the classifier to accurately predict whether a given image contains a cat.
